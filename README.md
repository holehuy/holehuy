**`ClickOps :) (Developer/Software Engineer/SA/DevOps/blabla)`**

I'm an full-stack and devops developer with a passion for new technologies that make a positive impact on society. Additionally, my background as an backend. Skilled in directing development with a creative and performance-oriented approach. All coding projects are built to learn and solve problems in the IT field (sometimes there are crazy projects LOL). All video content is built the same, from ideation, planning to content completion, although a bit unprofessional. I published it on my YouTube channel "[G√≥c c·ªßa ClickOps][youtube]" and no one seems to have subscribed yet LOL...
